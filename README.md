# AILib
AIlib aims to be a collection of function allowing to develop several kinds of AI. This project was started up to improove our knowledge about AIs and our skills in JAVA.

The project is not currently usable.

As we work on this in our free time and had learned by ourselves how an artificial neural network works denominations might not be accurate and implementation is far from optimal.
